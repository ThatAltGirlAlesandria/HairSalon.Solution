* _Now, open your command line again and make a commit. By making this commit BEFORE pushing to GitHub you will make sure the files that should be private/ not uploaded won't show. This is important because you don't want to share your username and password with the everyone!_

#### Now that you have downloaded the repo and open it in the text editor you need to open MySQL workbench.

* _Once you have finished the steps above locate the Schemas tab in the Navigator_

#### Final steps, connecting your new database to the HairSalon program.

* _Open the file, and paste the following code_
```{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=[your_database];uid=[user-id];pwd=[password];"
  }
}
```
